# Giphy App Vanilla JS üê∂


The code for this makes use of the following HTML, CSS, JS features: Local Storage, ES6 Import/Export Syntax, Classes, Arrow Functions, Static Methods, Callback Functions, Event Listeners, QuerySelector, GetElementById, Template Strings, Class List, CSS Psuedo-Classes, Flexbox and HTML5 Data Attributes.

## Task

1. Loading state This is shown while the gallery is being populated with images and when new images are
   fetched as the user scrolls.

2. View 2: Gallery Refresh-icon, which should reload the gallery and fetch new, randomized images when clicked. The
   images should be shown in their original proportions. Scrolling to the bottom should fetch new images and show
   them (infinite scroll). Clicking / tapping an image should open View 3.

3. View 3: Image This view should show a larger version of the clicked / tapped image, while retaining the image‚Äôs
   proportions. It should also show the previous and next image from the gallery and clicking / tapping these should
   open the corresponding image. The close button should return the user to View 2.

4. Use your best judgement to decide what the desktop view should look like. In the gallery, you should fetch GIFs from
   Giphy and present them in a gallery. We‚Äôd like you to use HTML, CSS (SASS) and vanilla Javascript (ES6) to read from
   Giphy‚Äôs API and to present the images. Please solve this without the use of npm-packages.
